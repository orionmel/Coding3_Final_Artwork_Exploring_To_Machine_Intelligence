## Project Summary
She drew a rough outline with stick figures, She tried to draw what she remembered as a lover and I invoked my learning ability to try to draw what humans wanted to look like, but the result was deformed, ugly, chaotic, unclear, and one day people said, "There must be ghosts in that machine, and they produce such a terrible look..."<br>
<br>
This project mainly satirizes the human worship of machines, but the fear of the power of the machine in the heart, when the machine outputs blurred and deformed images, humans think that ghosts and gods are in it, and the machine always tries to show the information provided by humans to the best and real look, but people have more unease about him.
