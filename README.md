## Project Summary
She drew a rough outline with stick figures, She tried to draw what she remembered as a lover and I invoked my learning ability to try to draw what humans wanted to look like, but the result was deformed, ugly, chaotic, unclear, and one day people said, "There must be ghosts in that machine, and they produce such a terrible look..."<br>
<br>
This project mainly satirizes the human worship of machines, but the fear of the power of the machine in the heart, when the machine outputs blurred and deformed images, humans think that ghosts and gods are in it, and the machine always tries to show the information provided by humans to the best and real look, but people have more unease about him.

## What I used in this project
This project is mainly through the pix2pix cGAN in machine learning to train images, by entering a rough sketch to convert into photos, because I want to create an app that let user painting and the machine guesses the image , so I trained this model with the existing pix2pix cGAN code. (more details can be viewed through the description below)
<br>
<br>
I use the dart language and flutter framework structure to create the UI and functionality of the app I want, and I'm running with the local API.

#### (1) Create home screen
#### (2) Create splash screen
#### (3) Draw and display
#### (4) Using neural network 、server and API
#### (5) Create rating button

## Final Outcomes：

## The future of my project:
Due to the problem of the model, the user needs to draw the portrait draft more accurately in order to finally display the avatar of a normal person, if not,it will eventually leads to blurring and deformity of the portrait. So in the future, I will try to train more portrait data so that the user can draw a normal portrait with just a few strokes.
